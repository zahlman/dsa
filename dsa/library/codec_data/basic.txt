# This is a resource file used by the `library.filters.string` interpreter.
# It specifies the interpretation of codes in [square brackets] embedded
# within the output strings. These can be translated to and from arbitrary
# binary data, even if that data would not be valid in the character encoding.

# This file is lexed the same way as type and structgroup files; but the
# interpretation is up to `library.codecs.string` codec loader, which will
# produce a StringCodec object used by the filter.

# Meta lines in these resource files indicate which codec loader to use.
# If another meta line were encountered, a new codec object would be produced
# for that "section", possibly using a different codec loader.

# Null terminators will not be represented in the output.
# We should allow them in input, assembling to zero bytes.

# When a '\n' appears in the source, represent it with a code
# and start a new string in the disassembly.

# Represent square brackets with square-bracket escapes.
5B false Open
5D false Close
# Any single bytes not recognized by the specified text encoding
# will also be square-bracket-escaped; this is hard-coded behaviour.
