# This is a resource file used by the `library.filters.string` interpreter.
# It specifies the interpretation of codes in [square brackets] embedded
# within the output strings. These can be translated to and from arbitrary
# binary data, even if that data would not be valid in the character encoding.

# This file is lexed the same way as type and structgroup files; but the
# interpretation is up to `library.codecs.string` codec loader, which will
# produce a StringCodec object used by the filter.

# Meta lines in these resource files indicate which codec loader to use.
# If another meta line were encountered, a new codec object would be produced
# for that "section", possibly using a different codec loader.
!basic string

# Null terminators will not be represented in the output, and will not
# be passed along for interpretation. However, by specifying an empty byte
# pattern, we allow for a code that explicitly represents end-of-string
# which may be used manually in files to be assembled.

# When a '\n' appears in the source, represent it with a code

# Any bytes not recognized by either the specified text encoding or by this
# explicit listing will also be escaped in square brackets.

# Another codec intended specifically for ASCII text that uses a lot more
# escapes.
