# This is a resource file used by the `string` interpreter.
# It specifies the interpretation of codes in [square brackets]
# embedded within the output strings. These can be translated to/from
# arbitrary binary data, even if that data would not be valid in the
# character encoding being used.
# This file is lexed the same way as type and structgroup files, but
# the interpretation is up to `string.py`.

# Null terminators will not be represented in the output.
# We should allow them in input, assembling to zero bytes.
[] false X
# When a '\n' appears in the source, represent it with a code
# and start a new string in the disassembly.

# Represent square brackets with square-bracket escapes.
5B false Open
5D false Close
# Any single bytes not recognized by the specified text encoding
# will also be square-bracket-escaped; this is hard-coded behaviour.
